# Basic built-in functions

Below are the general-purpose functions. For specialized functions, there are separate articles: [aggregate](../../aggregation.md), [window](../../window.md), as well as for [lists](../../list.md), [dictionaries](../../dict.md), [structures](../../struct.md), [data types](../../types.md), and [code generation](../../codegen.md).
