## FIRST_VALUE / LAST_VALUE

Accessing the values from the first and last rows of the [window border](../../../syntax/window.md#frame) (in the order of the window's `ORDER BY`). The only argument is the expression that you need to access.

Optionally, `OVER` can be preceded by the additional modifier `IGNORE NULLS`. It changes the behavior of functions to the first or last __non-empty__ (i.e., non-`NULL`) value among the window frame rows. The antonym of this modifier is `RESPECT NULLS`: it's the default behavior that can be omitted.

**Signature**
```
FIRST_VALUE(T)->T?
LAST_VALUE(T)->T?
```

**Examples**
```yql
SELECT
   FIRST_VALUE(my_column) OVER w
FROM my_table
WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY key);
```

```yql
SELECT
   LAST_VALUE(my_column) IGNORE NULLS OVER w
FROM my_table
WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY key);
```
