## WITH

It's set after the data source in `FROM` and is used for additional hints for tables. You can't use hints for subqueries and [named expressions](../../expressions.md#named-nodes).

The following values are supported:

* `INFER_SCHEMA`: Sets the flag for output of the table schema. Behaves similarly to the definition of a [yt.InferSchema pragma](../../pragma.md#inferschema), but only for a specific data source. The number of rows to be output (1 to 1,000) can be specified.
* `FORCE_INFER_SCHEMA` â€” defines a table schema output flag. Behaves similarly to the definition of a [yt.ForceInferSchema pragma](../../pragma.md#inferschema), but only for a specific data source. The number of rows to be output (1 to 1,000) can be specified.
* `DIRECT_READ`: Suppresses certain optimizers and enforces accessing table contents as is. Behaves similarly to the definition of a debugging [DirectRead pragma](../../pragma.md#debug), but only for a specific data source.
* `INLINE`: Hints that the table contents is small and you need to use its in-memory view to process the query. The actual size of the table is not controlled in this case, and if it's large, the query might fail with an out-of-memory error.
* `UNORDERED`: Suppresses original table sorting.
* `XLOCK`: Hints that you need to lock the table exclusively. It's useful when a table is read at the stage of [query metaprogram](../../action.md) processing. Table content is then refreshed in the main query. Avoids data loss if an external process managed to change the table between executing a metaprogram phase and the main part of the query.
* `SCHEMA` type: Hints that the specified table schema must be used entirely, ignoring the schema in the metadata.
* `COLUMNS` type: Hints that the specified types should be used for columns whose names match the table's column names in the metadata, as well as which columns are additionally present in the table.
* `IGNORETYPEV3`, `IGNORE_TYPE_V3`: Sets the flag to ignore type_v3 types in the table. Behaves similarly to the definition of a [yt.IgnoreTypeV3 pragma](../../pragma.md#ignoretypev3), but only for a specific data source.

When setting the `SCHEMA` and `COLUMNS` hints, the type must be a [structure](../../../types/containers.md).


If a `SCHEMA` hint is defined, then when using [EACH](#each), [RANGE](#range), [LIKE](#like), [REGEXP](#regexp), and [FILTER](#filter) table functions, an empty list of tables is permitted that is processed as an empty table with columns described in `SCHEMA`.


**Examples:**

```yql
SELECT key FROM my_table WITH INFER_SCHEMA;
SELECT key FROM my_table WITH FORCE_INFER_SCHEMA="42";
```

```yql
$s = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM my_table WITH XLOCK);

INSERT INTO my_table WITH TRUNCATE
SELECT EvaluateExpr($s) AS a;
```

```yql
SELECT key, value FROM my_table WITH SCHEMA Struct<key:String, value:Int32>;
```

```yql
SELECT key, value FROM my_table WITH COLUMNS Struct<value:Int32?>;
```

```yql
SELECT key, value FROM EACH($my_tables) WITH SCHEMA Struct<key:String, value:List<Int32>>;
```
