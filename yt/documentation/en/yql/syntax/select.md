{% note warning "Attention!" %}

Key columns always go before non-key columns in table schema {{product-name}}. The order of key columns is determined by the order of the composite key.
When `PRAGMA OrderedColumns;` is enabled, non-key columns preserve their output order.

{% endnote %}

When `PRAGMA OrderedColumns;` is used, the sequence of columns after [PROCESS](process.md)/[REDUCE](reduce.md) is not defined.
