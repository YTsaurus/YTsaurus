# Error codes

This section presents a collection of error codes that you may encounter when working with {{product-name}}.

The error code is a non-negative integer:

- `0` means a successful execution `NYT::EErrorCode::OK`.
- `1` means generic errors `NYT::EErrorCode::Generic`.

Other values are split between subsystems. To exactly construe certain errors, you need quite a deep knowledge of the system architecture. The list of errors is continuously expanded (mostly for backward compatibility reasons). If you have questions on error codes, please contact support:

- `community@ytsaurus.tech` newsletter.
