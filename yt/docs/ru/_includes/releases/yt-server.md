`ytsaurus/ytsaurus:stable-23.2.0-relwithdebinfo`

#### Scheduler

Many internal changes driven by developing new scheduling mechanics that separate jobs from resource allocations at exec nodes. These changes include modification of the protocol of interaction between schedulers, controller agents and exec nodes, and adding tons of new logic for introducing allocations in exec nodes, controller agents and schedulers.

List of significant changes and fixes:
  - Optimize performance of scheduler's Control and NodeShard threads.
  - Optimize performance of the core scheduling algorithm by considering only a subset of operations in most node heartbeats.
  - Optimize operation launch time overhead by not creating debug transaction if neither stderr or core table have been specified.
  - Add priority scheduling for pools with resource guarantees.
  - Consider disk usage in job preemption algorithm.
  - Add operation module assignment preemption in GPU segments scheduling algorithm.
  - Add fixes for GPU scheduling algorithms.
  - Add node heartbeat throttling by scheduling complexity.
  - Add concurrent schedule job exec duration throttling.
  - Reuse job monitoring descriptors within a single operation.
  - Support monitoring descriptors in map operations.
  - Support filtering jobs with monitoring descriptors in `list_jobs` command.
  - Fix displaying jobs which disappear due to a node failure as running and "stale" in UI.
  - Improve ephemeral subpools configuration.
  - Hide user tokens in scheduler and job proxy logs.
  - Support configurable max capacity for pipes between job proxy and user job.

#### Queue Agent

Aside small improvements, the most significant features include the ability to configure periodic exports of partitioned data from queues into  static tables and the support for using replicated and chaos dynamic tables as queues and consumers.

Features:
- Support chaos replicated tables as queues and consumers.
- Support snapshot exports from queues into static tables.
- Support queues and consumers that are symbolic links for other queues and consumers.
- Support trimming of rows in queues by lifetime duration.
- Support for registering and unregistering of consumer to queue from different cluster.

Fixes:
- Trim queues by its `object_id`, not by `path`.
- Fix metrics of read rows data weight via consumer.
- Fix handling frozen tablets in queue.

#### Proxy
Features:
- Add ability to call `pull_consumer` without specifying `offset`, it will be taken from `consumer` table.
- Add `advance_consumer` handler for queues.
- Early implementation of `arrow` format to read/write static tables.
- Support type conversions for inner fields in complex types.
- Add new per user memory usage monitoring sensors in RPC proxies.
- Use ACO for RPC proxies permission management.
- Introduce TCP Proxies for SPYT.
- Support of OAuth authorisation.

Fixes:
- Fix returning requested system columns in `web_json` format.


#### Dynamic Tables
Features:
- DynTables Query language improvments:
    - New range inferrer.
    - Add various SQL operators (<>, string length, ||, yson_length, argmin, argmax, coalesce).
- Add backups for tables with hunks.
- New fair share threadpool for select operator and network.
- Add partial key filtering for range selects.
- Add overload controller.
- Distribute load among rpc proxies more evenly.
- Add per-table size metrics.
- Store heavy chunk meta in blocks.


#### MapReduce

Features:
- Remote–°opy now supports cypress file objects, in addition to tables.
- Add support for per job experiments.
- Early implementation of CRI (container runtime interface) job environment & support for external docker images.
- New live preview for MapReduce output tables.
- Add support for arrow as an input format for MapReduce.
- Support GPU resource in exec-nodes and schedulers.

Enhancements:
- Improve memory tracking in data nodes (master jobs, blob write sessions, p2p tracking).
- Rework memory acccounting in controller agents.

#### Master Server

Noticeable/Potentially Breaking Changes:
  - Read requests are now processed in a multithreaded manner by default.
  - Read-only mode now persists between restarts. `yt-admin master-exit-read-only` command should be used to leave it.
  - `list_node` type has been deprecated. Users are advised to use `map_node`s or `document`s instead.
  - `ChunkService::ExecuteBatch` RPC call has been deprecated and split into individual calls. Batching chunk service has been superseded by proxying chunk service.
  - New transaction object types: `system_transaction`, `nested_system_transaction`. Support for transaction actions in regular Cypress transactions is now deprecated.
  - Version 2 of the Hydra library is now enabled by default. Version 1 is officially deprecated.

Features:
  - It is now possible to update master-servers with no read downtime via leaving non-voting peers to serve read requests while the main quorum is under maintenance.
  - A data node can now be marked as pending restart, hinting the replicator to ignore its absence for a set amount of time to avoid needless replication bursts.
  - The `add_maintenance` command now supports HTTP- and RPC-proxies.
  - Attribute-based access control: a user may now be annotated with a set of tags, while an access-control entry (ACE) may be annotated with a tag filter.

Optimizations & Fixes:
  - Response keeper is now persistent. No warm-up period is required before a peer may begin leading.
  - Chunk metadata now include schemas. This opens up a way to a number of significant optimizations.
  - Data node heartbeat size has been reduced.
  - Chunks and chunk lists are now loaded from snapshot in parallel.
  - Fixed excessive memory consumption in multicell configurations.
  - Accounting code has been improved to properly handle unlimited quotas and avoid negative master memory usage.

Additionally, advancements have been made in the Sequoia project dedicated to scaling master server by offloading certain parts of its state to dynamic tables. (This is far from being production-ready yet.)

#### Misc

Enhancements:
- Add rpc server config dynamization.
- Add support for peer alternative hostname for Bus TLS.
- Properly handle Content-Encoding in monitoring web-server.
- Bring back "host" attribute to errors.
- Add support for --version option in ytserver binaries.
- Add additional metainformation in yson/json server log format (fiberId, traceId, sourceFile).
